<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p class="mainbody">

<p class="writig"> Pulse the cauliflower in a food processor until its texture resembles rice.</p>

<p>
In a large wok or frying pan, heat a little of the coconut oil over high heat. Add the bacon and fry until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes, then remove and set aside. Wipe out the wok and add a little more coconut oil. <p>Add the chicken and sauté over high heat until golden and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
<p>Wipe the wok clean again, turn down the heat to medium, and add a little more coconut oil. Whisk eggs, adding a splash of fish sauce to season if desired.</p><p> Pour the eggs into the pan and cook, tilting the wok to let the uncooked eggs slide underneath the set eggs. Flip the omelet and cook until slightly golden, about 2 minutes. Remove, slice into thin strips, and set aside.
</p>

<p>  Heat a little of the coconut oil in the wok over high heat, add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the bell pepper and ginger and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. <p>Add the okra and Brussels sprouts and cook for 1 minute, then add the cauliflower and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. </p><p>Add the tamari, green onions, cilantro, parsley, bean sprouts, the reserved bacon, chicken, egg strips, and sea salt and ground white pepper to taste, and stir-fry for 1 minute until well combined.
